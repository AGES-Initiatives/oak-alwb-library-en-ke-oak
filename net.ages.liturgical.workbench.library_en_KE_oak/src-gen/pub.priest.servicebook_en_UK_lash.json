Master and Lord who loves mankind, hear us therefore as we implore your goodness on behalf of these servants of yours, and, as you are full of mercy, overlook all their faults. Deliver them from eternal punishment. For you said, Master, â€˜Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heavenâ€™. For you alone are without sin, and to you we give glory, together with your Father who is without beginning, and your all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.'}
